# mozilla_aws_cli_mozilla

This Python package implements the [`mozilla_aws_cli_config` API](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/mozilla-aws-cli#creating-enterprise--organization-configuration)
and configures a deployment of [`mozilla-aws-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/mozilla-aws-cli/)
with the specific configuration settings for Mozilla employees and contributors.

This package is only needed if you intend to use the `maws` to access AWS 
accounts owned by Mozilla.
